# Conner
In-development command-line survival-like game.

Currently the game is only available for Desktop Linux platforms, however I will release a tutorial video for how to compile the game within Termux (Android) or within Windows. YouTube channel that will host the tutorial video will be **AndrewStephenGames**.

Packages required for compilation:
* `git`
* `ncurses`
* `gcc` or `libllvm`
* any terminal emulator

Installation instructions:
* `git clone https://github.com/andrewstephengames/conner.git`
* `cd conner/`
* `cat game.sh` (in case you wanna know whether the script is malicious or not, spoiler alert: *it isn't*)
* `./game.sh`

Congratulations! You now have a binary of Conner!
